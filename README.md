# FusionAMM

FusionAMM is a hybrid (CLMM + OrderBook) AMM contract on the Solana blockchain.
This repository contains the Rust smart contract and SDKs to interact with a deployed program.

The official deployment of the FusionAMM contract can be found at the `fUSioN9YKKSa3CUC2YUc4tPkHJ5Y6XW1yz8y6F7qWz9`
address on:

- [Solana Mainnet](https://solscan.io/account/fUSioN9YKKSa3CUC2YUc4tPkHJ5Y6XW1yz8y6F7qWz9)
- [Solana Devnet](https://solscan.io/account/fUSioN9YKKSa3CUC2YUc4tPkHJ5Y6XW1yz8y6F7qWz9?cluster=devnet)

## Usage

This repository contains several libraries that can be used to interact with the FusionAMM contract. For most purposes
you can use our high-level SDKs, `@crypticdot/fusionamm` for Typescript projects, and `fusionamm` for Rust
projects.

For specific use-cases you can opt for integrating with lower level packages such as:

* `@crypticdot/fusionamm-client` & `fusionamm-client` - auto-generated client for the Whirlpools program that
  contains account, instruction and error parsing.
* `@crypticdot/fusionamm-core` & `fusionamm-core` - utility, math and quoting functions used by other packages.

## Local Development

This monorepo contains all the code needed to build, deploy and interact with the FusionAMM contract.

### Requirements

- Anchor v0.31.1
- Solana v2.1.22

### Deployment

Useful commands

```
// IDL init and upgrade:
anchor idl init --filepath ./target/idl/fusionamm.json fUSioN9YKKSa3CUC2YUc4tPkHJ5Y6XW1yz8y6F7qWz9
anchor idl upgrade --filepath ./target/idl/fusionamm.json fUSioN9YKKSa3CUC2YUc4tPkHJ5Y6XW1yz8y6F7qWz9

// Deploying:
solana program deploy ./target/deploy/fusionamm.so
