# FusionAMM Core SDK (WebAssembly)

This package provides developers with advanced functionalities for interacting with the FusionAMM Program on Solana.
Originally written in Rust, it has been compiled to WebAssembly (Wasm). This compilation makes the SDK accessible in
JavaScript/TypeScript environments, offering developers the same core features and calculations for their Typescript
projects. The SDK exposes convenient methods for math calculations, quotes, and other utilities, enabling seamless
integration within web-based projects.

## Installation
